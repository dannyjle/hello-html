        The art of animation has always been something that drew out wonder,
        curiosity, and most importantly joy in me. I remember waking up an hour
        earlier every morning so that I could catch an episode of Dragon Ball Z
        and Sailor Moon. It was my favorite pastime before I even knew people
        had pastimes.

        Eventually, I realized most people my age no longer watched animated
        cartoons, (let alone anime,) so I hid this form of escapism from the
        rest of the world. I never gave up on it thought and my passion for the
        art form only grew as I did. A book can transport you to another world,
        but it still relies a lot on your imagination. The animated content you
        consume can immerse you into someone elses world and your only real job
        is to enjoy the dive.
